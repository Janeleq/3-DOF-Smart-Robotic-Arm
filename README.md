## Overview
Creation of various parts of the arms was based on research on cycloidal gear system.
Programming controls for TLE9879 microcontroller and Arduino to execute the joints of the robotic arm
are paired with MIT App Inventor using Bluetooth which is then connected to the Arduino UNO.

## Program Flow
Upon Bluetooth pairing between the MIT application and Arduino, buttons on the applications can be held to send a one-byte integer, declared m, to the Arduino software to run specific codes that trigger various parts of the robotic arm.
